-- Migration 473: add triggered_org_id to agent_compliance_runs and create
-- agent_context_with_latest_test view.
--
-- Part of the #4247 compliance-state unification (PR 4 of 4). Today,
-- agent_contexts.last_test_* columns carry the most-recent test verdict
-- per (organization_id, agent_url). After PR #4250 owner runs write
-- canonical state via agent_compliance_runs, but that table tracks only
-- agent_url — there's no org dimension, so a derived "latest owner test"
-- can't be accurately scoped per org. Two orgs that own the same agent
-- (rare but possible — staging vs prod org of one publisher, for example)
-- would conflate.
--
-- Adding triggered_org_id closes the gap. Populated by the owner-test
-- write path in evaluate_agent_quality (this PR). Heartbeat / manual /
-- webhook writes leave it NULL.

ALTER TABLE agent_compliance_runs
  ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS triggered_org_id TEXT;

COMMENT ON COLUMN agent_compliance_runs.triggered_org_id IS
  'WorkOS organization ID of the org that triggered the run. Stored as TEXT (no FK) because WorkOS IDs are foreign-system keys — referential integrity against organizations.workos_organization_id is not enforced at the DB layer. Populated only for triggered_by=''owner_test''; heartbeat / manual / webhook rows leave it NULL.';

-- Index supports the derived `agent_context_with_latest_test` view's
-- per-(org, url) DISTINCT ON lookup. tested_at DESC keeps the latest-row
-- pull as a single index scan.
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_agent_compliance_runs_triggered_org_url_at
  ON agent_compliance_runs (triggered_org_id, agent_url, tested_at DESC)
  WHERE triggered_org_id IS NOT NULL;

-- View: agent_context joined with the latest agent_compliance_runs row
-- scoped to that org via triggered_org_id. Replaces direct reads of
-- agent_contexts.last_test_* columns.
--
-- The columns on agent_contexts stay for backward compat — recordTest()
-- still writes them for third-party (non-owner) runs, and a follow-up
-- migration drops them once recordTest() retires (gated on the
-- agent_test_history drop, which is itself gated on the soak windows
-- documented in #4247).
--
-- last_test_passed: derived from overall_status='passing'.
-- last_test_scenario: tracks_json[0].track when present, else 'compliance'
--   (heartbeat/manual writes don't carry the legacy 'quality_evaluation'
--   scenario string — the closest semantic in the canonical schema is the
--   first track of the run).
-- last_test_summary: agent_compliance_runs.headline.
-- last_tested_at: agent_compliance_runs.tested_at.
-- total_tests_run: COUNT(*) of agent_compliance_runs rows scoped to the
--   org+url. Was a per-context counter on the old column; the COUNT-based
--   derivation matches the new canonical semantics.
